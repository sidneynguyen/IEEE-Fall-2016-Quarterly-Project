# IEEE-Fall-2016-Quarterly-Project
Most of the code was written directly on the Raspberry Pi. This repo only contains some of the initial code we started with.
Our project ended up winning first place.

# What is it?
The IEEE UCSD Quarterly Project Fall 2016 is a project competition hosted by UC San Diego's IEEE branch. The goal was to build
a data-driven website using a Raspberry Pi as a webserver and sensors to collect data.
